This is the source to the SNES emulator used in the Steam release of *Dorke and Ymp*, published by Piko Interactive. It is built on code from the bsnes core of Mednafen, both of which are licensed under the GPLv2. No code or other assets from the actual game are included.

The code here is the unmodified source package exactly as distributed by the publisher. Don't ask us how to build it.
